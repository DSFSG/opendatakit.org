excerpt: "**Announcing changes to broaden our community**<br><br>Open Data Kit was started to make mobile data collection tools for resource-limited settings. Over the last 13 years, the project has produced two tool suites (ODK, ODK-X) and has become home to a community of users, implementers and developers. <br><br>To broaden the community that has grown around the project, we are retiring the use of the “Open Data Kit” brand and forming a new umbrella organization, [Data Software For Social Good (DSFSG)](https://dsfsg.org).<br><br>DSFSG aims to enable collaboration within the data software for social good ecosystem and welcome a diverse and independent set of member projects.<br><br>As an initial step in launching DSFSG, [ODK](https://getodk.org) and [ODK-X](https://odk-x.org) now each have their own web presence."
