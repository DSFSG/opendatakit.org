The [Surui Forest Carbon Project](http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=pt&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.equipe.org.br%2Fnoticia.php%3Fid%3D212&act=url) uses Open Data Kit to collect data about the forest for the carbon market. A recent blog post on Google’s Green Blog discusses how the Surui tribe is using ODK and Google Earth to help protect the Brazilian Amazon rainforest.

_Then, in 2009, Rebecca Moore, head of the Google Earth Outreach team, returned to the Amazon to teach the Surui about_ [_Open Data Kit_](/) _(ODK), a new suite of open-source tools that streamlines the process of data collection in the field with Android phones. Using ODK, the_ [_tribe takes pictures of what’s happening on the ground_](http://www.childrenoftheamazon.com/videos/trading-bows-arrows-for-laptops-one-year-later/) _for proof of the illegal logging that is taking place on their territory._

_The Surui also began using ODK and Google Earth to_ [_visualize the carbon reserves_](http://cfm.earthoutreach.org/partner-projects/idesam) _of the forest they live in. This process is part of their 50-year sustainability plan, and serves as a model for how indigenous tribes who have lost much of their ancestral land to logging and deforestation can thrive with the help of a new emerging market based on carbon credits._

_Chief Almir, in his joint presentation with Rebecca Moore, celebrated the validation of the_ [_Surui Forest Carbon Project_](http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=pt&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.equipe.org.br%2Fnoticia.php%3Fid%3D212&act=url) _on Saturday, May 12th at_ [_TEDxBeloHorizonte_](http://www.tedxbelohorizonte.com/) _in Brazil. This is a groundbreaking outcome for the Surui people for two reasons. First, this is the first indigenous-led project in the world to be validated. Equally important, it’s also the first REDD+ project in Brazil to get certified by both the_ [_Verified Carbon Standard_](http://v-c-s.org/) _(VCS) to sell stocks in the carbon market, and the_ [_Climate, Community and Biodiversity_](http://www.climate-standards.org/) _(CCB) Gold Standard to get extra gains from other ‘co-benefits’ of forest preservation, such as increasing biodiversity for a region, or preserving the livelihood of local communities who depend on the forest. The project was validated by Rainforest Alliance and the Brazilian NGO IMAFLORA._

_The Surui and their partner_ [_IDESAM_](http://www.idesam.org.br/) _have already measured a baseline of carbon stored in the indigenous reserve and will avoid the emission of 6 million tons of carbon over the 30 years of the life of the project by avoiding the deforestation of 40 thousand hectares of forests and protecting an additional 200,000 hectares. Coordinated by_ [_Forest Trends_](http://forest-trends.org/)_, the Surui will work with the Brazilian government and those who want to neutralize their emissions to develop financial mechanisms to ensure the forest is protected and well managed, while also assuring the quality of life for the Surui community. The primary financial vehicle has been designed by_ [_FUNBIO_](http://www.funbio.org.br/)_, a Brazilian NGO specializing in creating financial mechanisms for conservation._
