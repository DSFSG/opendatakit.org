An article by Nirab Pudasaini on [opensource.com](http://opensource.com) discusses how Kathmandu Living Labs leveraged ODK Collect and other open source technologies following the Nepal earthquake.

_By building on top of the existing ODK framework, we were able to add necessary features and customize the app to the projectâ€™s needs. We were able to use existing ODK server-side technologies and focus on improving the mobile app. In addition, the active community and fair amount of already existing online resources meant that we could always count on getting help when we got stuck._
