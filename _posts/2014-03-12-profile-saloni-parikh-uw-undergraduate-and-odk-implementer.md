People sometimes ask who are the members of the ODK team? While most members of the “core” ODK team are either University of Washington (UW) graduate students or staff; much of the customization and implementation work for field deployments is done by UW undergraduates. One such undergraduate, Saloni Parikh, was [profiled by the UW School of Public Health](http://sph.washington.edu/news/closeup/profile.asp?content_ID=4444). Saloni works with UW’s Department of Global Health to leverage ODK in Kenya.
