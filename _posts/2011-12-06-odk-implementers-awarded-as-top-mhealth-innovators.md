Dr. Martin Were and Dr. Joaquín Blaya, both long time ODK implementers, have been awarded two of the mHealth Alliance and Rockefeller Foundation’s [Top 11 in 2011 Innovators Challenge](http://healthunbound.org/top11_winners). 

Martin’s implementation of ODK Collect has been used by community health workers from AMPATH in Kenya during home visits for HIV counseling and testing for over 650,000 individuals. More recently, he has used ODK Clinic to help clinicians make faster and better decisions about care. 

Joaquín’s use of ODK Voice has addressed problems associated with non-communicable diseases by connecting patients to clinics via automated phone calls. Like Martin, his work ensures patients receive appropriate and effective care.

Both projects are due to a close collaboration with the University of Washington, and we are excited to see Martin and Joaquín recognized for their work using mobile technology in innovative ways to improve health systems and outcomes. Congrats to Martin and Joaquín and follow the links below to find out more!
