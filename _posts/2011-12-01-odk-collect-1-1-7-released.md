We are delighted to announce the release of ODK Collect 1.1.7!

In this release, we’ve added multiple questions per screen, secure network connectivity, a few new widgets and a lot of bug fixes that will make data collection a little easier. Find out all the new features on our [project roadmap](http://code.google.com/p/opendatakit/wiki/Roadmap).

If you have the Android Market, download it [here](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.odk.collect.android&hl=en) or by searching for “ODK Collect”. You can also find it on our [ODK Collect APK downloads](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect/releases) page.

If you are upgrading from Collect 1.1.5 and use our <http://opendatakit.appspot.com> demo server, please note that the http:// URL no longer works. Please change it to https://. If you have any other problems upgrading or installing this release, please file a detailed [bug report](http://code.google.com/p/opendatakit/issues/list).

As always, thanks for all your patience and your support. We hope you enjoy this release!
