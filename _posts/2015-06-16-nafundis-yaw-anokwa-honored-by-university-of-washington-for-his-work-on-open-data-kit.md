Every year, the University of Washington College of Engineering selects four outstanding individuals who have made significant contributions to the field of engineering and presents each with a Diamond Award. This year, ODK co-founder and [Nafundi](http://nafundi.com) CEO, Yaw Anokwa was selected for the [Diamond Award for Distinguished Service](http://www.engr.washington.edu/alumcomm/diamond/2015honorees.html#anokwa). The committee chose Yaw out of the tens of thousands of alumni because of his use of technology in helping the under-served.

The video below that played at the awards ceremony describes why Yaw is an ideal honoree. It has great insights from well-known ICTD researchers [Nicola Dell](http://www.nixdell.com/) and [Kentaro Toyama](http://www.kentarotoyama.org) on how Yaw and the rest of the ODK team’s community-focused management of the project enabled its success.

The video also has examples of Yaw’s commitment to the under-served, including Nafundi’s work with [WHO documenting polio coverage in South Sudan](http://nafundi.com/blog/posts/elqas-collecting-real-time-polio-vaccination-data-with-odk/), with [WWF protecting gorilla habitat in DR Congo](http://nafundi.com/blog/posts/helping-wwf-protect-gorilla-habitat-in-dr-congo/), and with [AMPATH counseling and testing over a million people for HIV in Kenya](http://nafundi.com/blog/posts/ampath-reaches-one-millionth-person/).



Yaw and I have been working together since the start of ODK and what I say at the end of video is as true today as it was then. As long as there are people collecting data who need help, we will be there to help.
