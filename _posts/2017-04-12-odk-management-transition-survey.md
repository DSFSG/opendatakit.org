The ODK team is conducting an [online survey](https://catalyst.uw.edu/webq/survey/wbrunett/329781) to solicit feedback from the community about Open Data Kit’s future management structure once it is transitioned from the University of Washington’s Department of Computer Science and Engineering (UW-CSE) in the fall 2017. An update about the transition can be found [here](https://opendatakit.org/2017/03/update-on-open-data-kit-transition/).

The [online survey](https://catalyst.uw.edu/webq/survey/wbrunett/329781) is intended to gather input from a variety of stakeholders about how the Open Data Kit project should evolve and has many free response questions to solicit people’s ideas about what the future of the ODK should look like.  We really want to encourage the users of ODK to actively influence how we grow ODK together by providing your input via this survey.

_Please help us reach a broad range of the ODK community by forwarding this survey to anyone you know that uses ODK._
