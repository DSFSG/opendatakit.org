[Bryan McBride](http://bryanmcbride.com/) is a certified GIS professional based out of New York’s Tech Valley, with a particular interest in open source GIS, web mapping, and application development. 

In his [Fun with the Open Data Kit](http://bryanmcbride.com/fun-with-the-open-data-kit) blog post, he writes, “_ODK has the potential to fill a crucial gap that has existed for years between low-end recreational GPS units (think eTrex) and high-end GPS data collectors (think Trimble)…There are tons of GPS and mapping apps already out there, but what we really need is a generic application that works with our custom data dictionaries or forms – and this is where ODK shines!_”

Bryan has created an fantastic open source GIS data collection system using ODK, PostGIS, GeoServer and Leaflet. If you are interested in GIS and ODK, try it out at [http://geoserving.net/odk_geoserver](http://geoserving.net/odk_geoserver/).
