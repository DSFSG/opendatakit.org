We’ve opened up a web-enabled chatroom for the ODK community. 

This chat is available for real-time communication with other community members. It can be an ideal way to get help with a problem you’re having, discuss development ideas, or just chat and share information.

You can login at <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=opendatakit>. For those familiar with [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat), you can also connect to [#opendatakit](irc://irc.freenode.net/opendatakit) on freenode.net. 

Please remember that the chatroom is not meant to be a 24/7 helpline with immediate support. The team will try to be in the chatroom often, but the best way to get support is still the mailing list at <opendatakit@googlegroups.com>.
