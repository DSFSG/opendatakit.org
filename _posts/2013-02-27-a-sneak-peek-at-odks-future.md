If you are interested in the future of Open Data Kit, read this [technical paper](http://www.hotmobile.org/2013/papers/full/2.pdf) describing the design and direction of ODK 2.0 that was presented at <a href="http://www.hotmobile.org/2013/" title="HotMobile" target="_blank">HotMobile 2013.</a> 

The paper will give you a sense for where ODK is headed, but note that the details of the ODK 2.0 tools (Survey, Tables, Sensors, Scan) will evolve as we integrate feedback from the community. 

Finally, while we are excited about the new use-cases that ODK 2.0 will enable, we are very committed to using, extending, and supporting ODK 1.0. 

Build, Collect, and Aggregate will be here with us for many more years!
