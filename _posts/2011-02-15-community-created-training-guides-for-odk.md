Emily Kumpel, a PhD student in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Berkeley, has posted a narrative about her [experiences using Open Data Kit](http://ekumpel.wordpress.com/2011/02/13/135/) (ODK) for a health, economics, and water quality effects study. She reflects on the steps they went through, from the decision to use ODK to the first round of data collection. It’s a great read that builds on the other [training guides](http://code.google.com/p/opendatakit/wiki/TrainingGuide) on our wiki. 

As developers, we try to build on the work of others, and it’s fantastic to see our implementers doing the same! If you would like to help us organize our community documentation efforts, please drop us an e-mail at <contact@opendatakit.org>.
