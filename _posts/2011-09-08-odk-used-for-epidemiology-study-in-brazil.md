Maria Emília Midori Hirami is an engineering student at USP (University of São Paulo – Brazil) and she’s working on a project of epidemiological studies headed by professors from POLI and FMUSP (USP’s engineering and medicine schools respectively). The project uses Open Data Kit as one of its key tools.

She writes, “_On [our] last project, Prof. Dr. P. R. Menezes and his team at FMUSP completed over 2000 surveys in São Paulo and Amazonas using PalmTops with the app EpiSurveyor. On account of some difficulties with both device and software, me and some other students, coordinated by Prof. Dr. A. C. Seabra at POLI, have been working to find the most appropriate tool for them and this is where ODK enters. Last week, we finished the construction of a [questionnaire] that helps depression diagnosis and has over 200 questions. The interviewers will test it with ODK Collect on the coming weeks and we’re waiting anxiously for the results. We also have another form of a [pregnancy] study ready to use. Our goal is to further increase the number of participants to reach a significant portion of the population that depends on the Brazilian public health system. Our group would like to thank you for all your efforts!_”
