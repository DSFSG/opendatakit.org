The ODK core team is currently in the process of creating a new version of the ODK tool set (often referred to as 2.0). To make informed design decisions, the ODK team would like to gather some information about how the current tools are being used to enable future design decisions to better reflect our customers actual use cases and needs.

Therefore, the ODK team is requesting that all ODK users please fill out a brief survey that should take 5 to 10 minutes. The survey is completely voluntary but the ODK team would really like to receive feedback from everyone. We want to hear from a large range of people. This includes users who have deployed ODK in the field and ranges to people who have chosen another data gathering tool after testing ODK. We would also like to hear from people who have only begun to look at ODK for possible future use. Basically everyone.

The survey is available here:

Thanks in advance for dedicating some of your valuable time to provide feedback to the ODK Team!

We really appreciate it!
