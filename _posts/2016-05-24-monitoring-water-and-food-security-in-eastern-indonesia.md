In the eastern Indonesian province of Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) problems of water and food security are chronic and threaten lives and livelihoods. The Province has a monsoonal wet-dry tropical climate, and water resources are limited, with high inter-annual variability. Most of the people of NTT live in rural areas and rely on agriculture for their livelihoods.

_Slope mass failure resulting in blockage of the primary irrigation channel. This results in areas downstream having no water for irrigation and growing food. ODK is a useful tool for local farmers to record this information and inform maintenance managers of the need for repair._

As part of an Indonesian and International Research Partnership, Nusa Cendana University (UNDANA) and Charles Darwin University (CDU) trialed ODK as a tool to collect information on maintenance needs in poor and remote irrigated farming areas. Irrigation infrastructure in the areas is in need of regular maintenance to ensure equitable distribution of water thereby eradicating the “hungry season.”

We found ODK very useful and straightforward to apply and ideal for the planned application in these underserved communities. We hope to continue working in NTT with communities and government using ODK to empower local communities to collect information for the government as a basis for establishing maintenance priorities.
