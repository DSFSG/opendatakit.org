Three members of the ODK team Waylon Brunette, Nicola Dell, and Morgan Vigil led a open source session on Oct 5th at [Grace Hopper Open Source Day](http://gracehopper.org/2013/conference/grace-hopper-open-source-day/ "Grace Hopper Open Source Day") in Minneapolis, MN, USA. 

About 20 open source participants spent the day improving various ODK tools. One group focused on fixing Briefcaseâ€™s ability to pull files over USB on Android 4.x phones (unfortunately, there is still a lack of library support for MTP devices on various platforms). Another group of participants contributed to improving widget layouts in Survey while others contributed to ODK newest tool Submit (which is unreleased).
