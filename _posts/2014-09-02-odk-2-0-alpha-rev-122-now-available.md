A [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.opendatakit.org/odk2/) walks through using and modifying a form, and highlights many of the capabilities of the 2.0 tools, including bi-directional sync with the server.

The 2.0 tools are in <font color="blue">Alpha</font> or <font color="blue">Beta</font> status. We are referring to the combined set of tools as the “rev 122” software.

The rev 122 software works with the just-released ODK Aggregate v1.4.4.
