[Carbon For Water](http://www.vestergaard-frandsen.com/carbon-for-water/index.html) ([@CarbonForWater](https://twitter.com/Carbonforwater)) is using 4000 ODK-enabled phones to collect 40,000 forms per day. The data is used to support [Vestergaard Frandsen](http://www.vestergaard-frandsen.com/)‘s campaign to distribute LifeStraw Family water treatment units to 4 million people in Western Kenya. 

Evan Thomas of [Manna Energy](http://www.mannaenergy.com/) writes, “_ODK has enabled us to easily train 4,000 community health workers in how to use the smartphone application, and we are now getting records in at a rate of about 50 per minute [about 40,000/day]. We expect a total of over one million records by June 1, 2011. This project has broad reach. We even have an astronaut on the [International Space Station](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition27/index.html) who is monitoring the project via the ODK database_.”

We just found out Carbon For Water a few days ago, and we’ll be blogging more about their work over the next few weeks. In the meanwhile, we’d love to hear about how you use ODK (especially if you use it in space). Share your story at <contact@opendatakit.org>.
