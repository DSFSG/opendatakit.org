Max Heinritz (@[maxheinritz](http://twitter.com/maxheinritz)) has implemented an Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) system using ODK. 

EGRA is an education evaluation instrument used to measure student literacy in developing countries. The test is administered by trained enumerators who assess samples of students at multiple schools. Results are currently recorded on paper and then manually digitized when enumerators return from fieldwork. With the ICT system introduced here, results would instead be recorded on mobile phones and transmitted over the Internet. 

Matt has put all the resources from his project (including papers, talks, user guides, demo videos and analysis scripts) at [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~heinritz/ict4egra](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~heinritz/ict4egra/).
