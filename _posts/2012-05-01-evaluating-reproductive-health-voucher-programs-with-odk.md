A reproductive health voucher is a card that entitles a poor, pregnant woman to subsidized maternity care. These vouchers are used around the world, but do they actually help improve the quality of care? The [Population Council](http://www.popcouncil.org/)â€˜s [RHVouchers](http://www.rhvouchers.org/) ([@RHVouchers](https://twitter.com/#!/rhvouchers)) project is evaluating voucher programs in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Bangladesh and Cambodia to find out.

As one could expect, these evaluations are an intensive process of collecting, organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data. The process happens over largely rural areas with vast distances between households and health service providers. In the video below, Population Council researchers, together [Marie Stopes Uganda](http://www.mariestopes.org/Where_we_work/Countries/Uganda.aspx) staff show how they are using ODK to streamline the evaluation of voucher programs. The work is funded by the [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](http://www.gatesfoundation.org).
