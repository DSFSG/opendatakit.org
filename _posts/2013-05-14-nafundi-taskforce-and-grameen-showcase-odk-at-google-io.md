[Google I/O](https://developers.google.com/events/io/) is an annual developer conference that showcases the latest from Google’s product teams and partners. One of the exciting parts of I/O is the Developer Sandbox, where apps based on technologies and products are shown to attendees.

This year, three out of the nine presenters in the “[Develop for Good](https://developers.google.com/events/io/developer-sandbox#t-develop-for-good)” sandbox will be showcasing ODK-based projects! The three presenters are [Nafundi](http://nafundi.com), [Taskforce for Global Health](http://taskforce.org), and [Grameen Foundation](http://www.grameenfoundation.org/). Staff from all three organizations will be at I/O in San Francisco this week, so swing by their booths, and say hello!

Also present at I/O will be ODK core team members from the University of Washington. If you’ve ever wanted to chat with Waylon, Mitch, or Sam in person, now is your chance! Find them on the conference floor, share your ODK use case, and maybe get a demo of the upcoming tools.

If you won’t be at I/O, make sure to check out Nafundi’s [ODK customization services](http://nafundi.com), Taskforce’s [LINKS system](http://linkssystem.org), Grameen’s [TaroWorks system](http://taroworks.org/), and UW’s paper on [ODK’s future](/2013/02/a-sneak-peek-at-odks-future/).
