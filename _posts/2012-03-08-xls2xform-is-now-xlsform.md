Not just the name has changed, we now share a updated syntax with [Formhub](https://formhub.org/).

There is some backwards compatibility with the old syntax but we encourage you to transition to using the new syntax documented [here](https://docs.opendatakit.org/xlsform).

Additionally, we made some improvements to our error messages, but hopefully you never find out what they are.

If you find run into any problems, please post them to our[ issue tracker](https://code.google.com/p/opendatakit/issues/list), or bring them up on our [community mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/opendatakit).

And finally, here’s a link to XLSForm <a href="/xlsform" target="_blank">here</a>
