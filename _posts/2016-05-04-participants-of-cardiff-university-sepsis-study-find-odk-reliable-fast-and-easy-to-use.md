In a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, researchers at Cardiff University have successfully used Open Data Kit to measure the prevalence of sepsis in Wales over 24 hours. 

Researchers show that by combining a reliable Android device, a free open-source data collection framework, a scalable cloud-based server, and a team of 184 medical students, they could deliver a low-cost, highly reliable platform that requires little training or maintenance, providing results immediately on completion of data collection.
