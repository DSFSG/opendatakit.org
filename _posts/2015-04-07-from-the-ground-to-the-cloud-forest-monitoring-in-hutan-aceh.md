Hutan Aceh is the endangered home of tigers, elephants, orangutans and rhinos. [EIA International](http://eia-international.org) and local activists from Koalisi Peduli Hutan Aceh (KPHA) protect this home by documenting forest crimes with Open Data Kit. The geo-tagged forms, rich with photos, provide the evidence needed to save habitat.

EIA has a [great post on the Hutan Aceh project](http://eia-international.org/hutan-aceh-forest-monitoring-from-the-ground-to-the-cloud), and the [video](http://player.vimeo.com/video/109241884) below does a great job explaining the project. Visit [hutan-aceh.com](http://www.hutan-aceh.com) to view images from the ground.
