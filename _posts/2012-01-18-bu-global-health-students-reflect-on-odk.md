[Christopher Gill](http://sph.bu.edu/index.php?option=com_sphdir&id=239&Itemid=617263&INDEX=10453) is an Associate Professor of International Health at Boston University (BU). After experiencing a year delay between when a study ended and when he got data, Chris started looking for a easy, free, and user-friendly program to collect study data. 

As part of those explorations, Chris found Open Data Kit and recruited School of Public Health (SPH) students Marion McNabb and Laura Khurana to train fellow BUSPH students on how to use ODK. The students have put some of the discussions they had, forms they created, and feedback they had [online](https://bu.digication.com/IH743/Building_and_Collecting_Data_on_a_Smartphone). If you are thinking about implementing ODK for a global health research project, it is a great to start. 

Below is video with some of their thoughts on using ODK.
