[eHealth Nigeria](http://ehealthnigeria.org) did a training for the Population and Reproductive Health Initiative (PRHI), an organization based at the [Ahmadu Bello Teaching Hospital](http://www.abuth.org/) in Zaria, on how to use Open Data Kit. PRHI is using ODK as a way to collect demographic and health information on women living in one of the nearby villages. Below are blog posts and videos from that training.
