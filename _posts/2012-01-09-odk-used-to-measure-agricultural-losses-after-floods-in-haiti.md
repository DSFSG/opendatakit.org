Reporting for [Haiti Regeneration Initiative](http://haitiregeneration.org/node/993) (HRI), Kate Kennedy Freeman writes, “_The [Côte Sud Initiative](http://haitiregeneration.org/csi_intro_wsubs) (CSI) has launched a new program as part of its agricultural support sector. The [Earth Institute](http://earth.columbia.edu) (EI) at Columbia University is working with the [Organization for the Rehabilitation of the Environment](http://oreworld.org) (ORE), an NGO with a strong presence in the Côte Sud region, to pilot a new cell phone based survey tool to monitor agricultural practices, crop productivity, and farmer yields of crops._”

In October 2011, staff from EI and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) trained a group of agronomists and staff members from CSI on ODK. HRI reports that during “_the week of the ORE ict4Ag training, the South Department experienced severe flooding as a result of heavy rains in the region. Anticipating widespread damage to personal property and infrastructure, UNEP asked ORE to undertake a rapid agricultural assessment to gauge the agriculture losses caused by the flooding. ORE agronomists were able to use their new phones and take advantage of their new ODK knowledge to undertake a rapid agricultural assessment._”

Congratulations to the ORE team on their quick transition from training to field usage! Find out more about their work at <http://haitiregeneration.org>.
