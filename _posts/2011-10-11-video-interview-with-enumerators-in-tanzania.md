In July through September of 2011, the [Africa Soil Information Service](http://africasoils.net/) (AfSIS) ICT4Ag team conducted a socioeconomic survey in an area west of Arusha, Tanzania using Open Data Kit. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afrxy8rIn2M) highlights the experience of two enumerators who worked on the project.



If you want to find out more, the [AfSIS ICT4Ag blog](http://africasoils.net/labs/mapping/enumerators-offer-perspectives-on-ict4ag-pilot-survey/) has lots of great posts on using ODK for agricultural data collection.
