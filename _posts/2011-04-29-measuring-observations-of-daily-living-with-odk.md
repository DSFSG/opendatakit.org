The BreathEasy application is designed to be an easy-to-use tool that allows study participants to enter observations of daily living (ODLs) such as peak flow readings, asthma triggers, stress and activity levels, sleep patterns, symptoms and medication use. 

BreathEasy is built using ODK tools and you can find out more [here](http://projecthealthdesign.typepad.com/project_health_design/2011/03/breatheasy-android-application-and-web-dashboard-design.html).
