[LINKS](http://linkssystem.org) is an ODK-based data collection, reporting, and management system created by the [The Task Force for Global Health](http://taskforce.org). As part of their work, the LINKS team provides their users with a finalized dataset and a codebook that explains that dataset. Generating a codebook can be tedious work, so the LINKS team hired the consultants at [Nafundi](http://nafundi.com) to automate the process. 

Nafundi has created [LINKS Codebook](http://linkssystem.org/support/Task-Force-LINKS-Codebook-v1.1.zip), a desktop application which takes an ODK compliant XForm and generates a codebook in PDF (with multiple languages). Codebook is perfect for users who download ODK datasets and need to understand what variables correspond with what prompts. Itâ€™s free, easy to use, and as you can see below, produces beautiful codebooks.
