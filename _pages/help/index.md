Our community produces two suites of software: ODK and ODK-X (formerly ODK 2).

The ODK suite contains our most well-known and widely deployed tools, so we recommend you start there! If you find that the ODK suite does not meet your needs, then try the ODK-X suite. See [Software](/software) for more.

## Documentation

Our community maintains a comprehensive set of documentation for all the tools. If you need help, the docs are the best place to get help.

* Read the [ODK Docs](https://docs.opendatakit.org)

* Read the [ODK-X Docs](https://docs.opendatakit.org/odk-x)

## Forum

If you don't find the help you need in the documentation, the community forum has thousands of members and it is the fastest way to get support.

* Join the [forum](https://forum.opendatakit.org)

If you have a private issue that cannot be posted to the public forum, please email project leadership at <team@opendatakit.org>.
