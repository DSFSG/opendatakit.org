An important goal of the Open Data Kit community is to enable users to select suitable components from an ecosystem of complementary tools. A thriving ecosystem means that organizations can use the tools that best suit their needs without worrying about vendor lock-in.

## ODK
The ODK tools include Collect, Aggregate, XLSForm, Build, Briefcase, and Central. The shared components that enable ODK core tools to be compatible with a broad ecosystem are:
* [ODK XForms](https://opendatakit.github.io/xforms-spec/), a low-level form specification based on XForms
* [XLSForm](http://xlsform.org), a high-level Excel-based form specification
* [OpenRosa APIs](https://docs.opendatakit.org/openrosa/), APIs for how ODK clients talk to ODK servers
* [ODK JavaRosa](https://github.com/opendatakit/javarosa), a Java library that processes ODK XForms
* [pyxform](https://github.com/xlsform/pyxform), a Python library that converts XLSForms into ODK XForms

The ecosystem members who openly collaborate to grow this ecosystem are:
* [ELMO](http://getelmo.org), hosted server originally designed for election monitoring
* [Enketo](https://enketo.org), web application for filling forms in the browser
* [Kobo Toolbox](http://www.kobotoolbox.org), hosted server with graphical form builder
* [Medic Mobile](https://medicmobile.org), hosted server for frontline medical care
* [Ona](https://ona.io), hosted server with graphical form builder
* [SMAP](https://www.smap.com.au), hosted server with tasking
