ODK is an open source software project that is free for anyone to download, use, and adapt. Our work is supported by a growing community of developers, implementers, and users -- as well as various organizations. Core ODK development is supported by ongoing research at the University of Washington's [Change Group](http://change.washington.edu) and Department of Computer Science & Engineering (UW-CSE); as well as through financial contributions from users.

We encourage everyone to [get involved directly](/community/) in the work of the ODK Community. If you would like to support ODK's continued research and development financially, you can also [donate through the University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/giving/make-a-gift?source_typ=3&source=CSEODK).
