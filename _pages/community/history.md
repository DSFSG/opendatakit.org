The Open Data Kit project produces software that helps organizations author, collect, and manage mobile data collection solutions. Our goals are to make open-source and standards-based tools which are easy to try, easy to use, easy to modify and easy to scale.

The project began as a Google.org sponsored sabbatical project under the direction of [Gaetano Borriello](http://www.cse.washington.edu/homes/gaetano) in April of 2008 at Google's Seattle offices. The initial team included Bill Schilit of Google Research, Adam Lerer of MIT, and Julie Chin of Google.org. University of Washington (UW) graduate students Carl Hartung, Yaw Anokwa, and Waylon Brunette joined the team soon thereafter and were responsible for the first two deployments of the tools in Uganda and Brazil.

Gaetano, Carl, Yaw, and Waylon brought Open Data Kit back to UW in September of 2009 and Mitchell Sundt joined the team as a software engineer in 2010. Clarice Larson joined the team as a software engineer in 2013, and Jeff Beorse returned as a software engineer in 2015. Richard Anderson has led the project since Gaetano passed away in early 2015. Other contributors at UW include Brian DeRenzi, Rohit Chaudhri, Nicola Dell, and countless others.

In late 2016, the project began a transition out of UW. It is now supported by a growing community of users, implementers, and developers.
