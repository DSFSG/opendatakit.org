Open Data Kit is an open and welcoming community of people just like you! Our mission is to help millions around the world collect, manage, and use their data.

We value open communities and open source and our work is user-focused and deployment-centric. See our [Mission and Values](https://github.com/opendatakit/governance/blob/master/MISSION-AND-VALUES.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/opendatakit/governance/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) for more.

We follow a meritocratic governance model where a Project Management Committee oversees the project while two Technical Steering Committees oversee the technical direction of their respective suites of software: ODK and ODK-X. See [Governance](/community/governance) for more.
